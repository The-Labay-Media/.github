<h1 align="center">The Labay Media</h1>

The Labay Media is a group made in Labay Middle School (LMS) to make software products to help benefit the students of Labay. I Believe that the school has been getting boring, fights and drama vaulted.

# Our Goals

Our goal is to make Labay more fun and enthusiastic, the adults think we have fun, but since there is no Recess, it isnt that much fun, especially ContentKeeper, so my goal is to fix that up and make the students like Labay More.
